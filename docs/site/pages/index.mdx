# AstraForge Documentation

**AstraForge is a sandboxed execution engine for AI agents that can safely run real code.**

AstraForge provides isolated, ephemeral execution environments that allow LLM-based agents to run Python, shell commands, and workflows securely, without risking the host system. Agents need to execute real workloads to debug, test, and remediate systems; running that code directly on the host is a security and stability risk. AstraForge solves this by providing real execution with auditable logs, diffs, and guardrails.

## Core Features

- **Secure Sandboxing:** Coding agents run in isolated Codex workspaces with auto-MR guardrails, while LangChain DeepAgents use managed sandboxes (network guards, ephemeral secrets) for safe debugging.
- **Auto-remediation to Merge:** Glitchtip/Sentry alerts forward stack traces and metadata into Codex workspaces, allowing agents to produce patches, tests, and merge requests automatically.
- **Shared Workspaces:** Human reviewers and LLM executors can attach to the same streamed workspace, replaying runs and resuming conversations.
- **Reviewability:** Diff previews, run logs, and chat summaries keep reviewers in the loop before changes land.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Supports Docker (single host) for local dev and Kubernetes (standard, gVisor, or Kata/Firecracker) for production isolation.
