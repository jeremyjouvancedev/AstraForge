# Contributing

We welcome updates to both the product and the documentation. Keep these guardrails in mind when editing the docs site.

## How to work on docs

1. Install dependencies in `docs/site` (use `pnpm install`).
2. Run the local server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

3. Edit or add MDX pages under `docs/site/pages`. Update `_meta.json` to surface new pages in the sidebar.
4. Build or export to validate static output:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm export
```

## Style and content guidelines

- Prefer concise, task-oriented sections with clear commands for backend (`make backend-serve`), frontend (`make frontend-dev`), and testing (`make test` or `make compose-test`).
- Keep the canonical system diagram in `docs/architecture.md` up to date whenever architecture changes. Mirror critical diagrams here when they help readers.
- Keep links stable; use relative paths within the docs site and avoid hard-coding environment-specific URLs.
- Remember the sandbox parity rule: if you document sandbox behavior, ensure both `backend/astraforge/sandbox/deepagent_backend.py` and `astraforge-python-package/astraforge_toolkit/backend.py` match the described contract.
