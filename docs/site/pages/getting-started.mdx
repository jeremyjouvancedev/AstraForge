# Getting started

Follow these steps to run AstraForge locally with the provided Make targets and pnpm tooling.

## Prerequisites

- pnpm `9.x`
- Python 3.11+ with virtualenv support
- Docker (required for compose-based flows and sandbox containers)

If you are missing dependencies, run the bootstrap target from the repo root:

```bash
make install-deps
```

## Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust secrets, database URLs, and sandbox options to match your local setup. Keep `PROVISIONER` aligned with your chosen runtime (`docker` or `k8s`).

## Run the stack locally

Start the Django API and workers:

```bash
make backend-serve
```

Launch the Vite frontend in another terminal:

```bash
make frontend-dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:8001` and the frontend dev server on `http://localhost:5174` (with proxies configured by default).

## Tests

Before pushing changes, run the combined backend and frontend suites:

```bash
make test
```

For containerized isolation, use the compose workflow:

```bash
make compose-test
```

This spins up Postgres/Redis, waits for readiness, runs the tests in containers, and tears everything down afterward.
